# Stock Analysis With Excel VBA

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project was to refactor a Microsoft Excel VBA code to collect certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018 and determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing. This process was originally completed in a similar format, however, the goal for this round was to increase the efficiency of the original code.

### The Data

The data that is presented includes two charts with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information contains a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The goal is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.
##Results

### Analysis

In studying the original code, I was not sure how refactoring was going to make a difference in the speed in which it ran. By looking at the instructions it appeared that by creating several more arrays, the code then could search the arrays and not the entire spreadsheet over and over. I must admit that I did not originally understand how this would help.

## Summary

### Pros and Cons of Refactoring Code

In theory, refactoring code makes it more efficient and, in many cases, easier to follow. Many times, original code is a first stab at fixing a unique problem. Once the code is completed and reviewed, then refactoring can be used to simplify its design. Disadvantages of refactoring include, more time being spent on the project and possibly breaking something that is already working. In addition, some code is just too large and complex to refactor.

### The Advantages of Refactoring Stock Analysis
The biggest benefit that occurred as a result of the refactoring was a decrease in macro run time. The original analysis took approximately one second to run, whereas our new analysis only took a third of that amount of time.
